# 🛒 Big Data Retail Purchase Analysis with PySpark

This project performs exploratory data analysis on retail purchase data using **PySpark** and visualizes key business metrics using **Matplotlib**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from large-scale retail transaction data and present them in a clear, visual format.

## 📁 Files Included

- `BigDataAnalyst.py`: Main script that performs data loading, transformation, aggregation, and visualization.
- `project1_df.csv`: Dataset containing transaction-level retail purchase records.
- `chart_*.png`: A set of charts visualizing insights (auto-generated by the script).

## 📊 Insights & Visualizations

The project focuses on analyzing **customer purchasing behavior** across multiple dimensions:

1. **Hourly Trends** – What time of day customers spend the most.
2. **Weekly Patterns** – How spending varies across days of the week.
3. **Monthly Spending** – Seasonality in purchase amounts.
4. **Product Categories** – Which categories yield the highest average spend.
5. **Top Locations** – Locations with the highest number of transactions.
6. **Payment Methods** – Most frequently used payment modes.

All results are visualized using **Matplotlib** charts.

## 🔍 What I Did

- Loaded and processed structured CSV data using PySpark DataFrames.
- Parsed timestamps and extracted useful date-time features like hour, day of the week, and month.
- Performed grouped aggregations using PySpark SQL functions to find average, min, and max net amounts.
- Visualized insights through six different charts by converting Spark DataFrames to Pandas.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Practical usage of **PySpark** for large dataset analysis.
- Efficiently handling **date-time features** and performing time-based aggregation.
- Creating business-relevant insights through data transformations.
- Generating visual analytics reports using **Matplotlib**.
- Interpreting customer behavior trends from raw transaction data.

## 🏢 Industry Relevance

This type of analysis is widely used in:

- **Retail and E-commerce** for optimizing store hours, marketing campaigns, and product inventory.
- **Customer Behavior Analytics** to understand peak shopping times and preferred payment methods.
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards** that inform decision-makers using data-driven insights.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have PySpark and Matplotlib installed:
2. Place `project1_df.csv` in the same directory as `BigDataAnalyst.py`.
3. Run the script:

Charts will be saved as `.png` files in the same folder.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add interactive dashboard using **Plotly Dash** or **Streamlit**.
- Enable filtering based on date range, location, or category.
- Connect to a live data source like a retail database or API.
